We have added instructions below on how to fix the most common problems. We are also in the process of adding device specific instructions.",
  "Q2": "No access to Apple Health",
  "A2": "In order to work using your existing sleep data, Nyxo requires a Read-access to Apple Health. When you first start using Nyxo, you're prompted to enable this access. Access to Apple can only be provided in the Health App.",
  "Q3": "Nyxo is showing different information for last night than my tracker",
  "A3": "Sometimes the sleep tracking information might differ between Nyxo and your sleep trackers own app. This might be caused by Nyxo using a different tracking source, or because your sleep trackers saves the data in different format to Apple Health. Please ensure that you have chosen your primary sleep tracker as the source in the settings. You can change your sleep tracker by going to the Settings page and selecting the 'Select Tracking Source' section.",
  "Q4": "How do I change my sleep tracking source?",
  "A4": "You can change your sleep tracker by going to the Settings page and selecting the 'Select Tracking Source' section.",
  "Q5": "I'm using charging time and device usage as the tracking method, but it's not showing anything?",
  "A5": "When using chargin time and device usage as the tracking method, it sometimes takes a little bit of time before Nyxo will learn to track accurately. Therefore it might take couple of nights before the tracking becomes accurate. Before this you can use the manual tracking, by initianing the sleep tracking on the main page.",
